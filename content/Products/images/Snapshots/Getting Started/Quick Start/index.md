# **Quick Start Guide for Managing Snapshots in Utho Cloud**

Snapshots in Utho Cloud allow you to save and restore the state of your cloud servers at a particular point in time. This feature is useful for backup purposes or when you need to roll back to a previous server state. Below is a quick guide on how to view, restore, and delete snapshots within the Utho Cloud platform.

### **1. How to View Snapshots**

* Navigate to the **Snapshot Listing Page** or click [here](https://console.utho.com/snapshot) to view all snapshots.
* On this page, you can view important snapshot details, including:
  * **ID** : Unique identifier for the snapshot.
  * **Name** : The name you assigned to the snapshot.
  * **Cloud ID** : The ID of the cloud server that the snapshot belongs to.
  * **Size** : The size of the snapshot.
  * **Snapshot Location** : The data center location where the snapshot is stored.
  * **Created At** : The date and time the snapshot was created.
  * **Restore** : An action button to restore the snapshot to your server.
  * **Action** : A **Delete** icon to remove the snapshot.

### **2. How to Restore a Snapshot**

* On the  **Snapshot Listing Page** , find the snapshot you want to restore.
* Click on the **Restore** button next to the snapshot.
* A confirmation popup will appear asking if you're sure you want to restore the snapshot.
* Click **OK** to confirm. The restoration process will begin, and the cloud server will be restored to the state it was in when the snapshot was taken.
  **Important:** Restoring a snapshot will overwrite the current state of the server with the snapshot's state. Any data or changes made after the snapshot was created will be lost.

* At the end of the snapshot row, click the **Delete** button.
