# **How to Add ISO**

## **Overview**

Adding an ISO file to your Utho Cloud account allows you to deploy custom installations seamlessly. The process involves selecting the appropriate data center, entering the ISO URL, and assigning a name for the ISO. Once added, you can use the ISO for provisioning virtual machines or configuring servers.

## **Steps to Add ISO**

### **1. Navigate to the ISO Listing Page**

* After logging in, go to the  **ISO Listing Page** .
* You can access this page by clicking on **ISOs** in the sidebar or directly visiting [this link](https://console.utho.com/iso "ISO Listing Page").

### **2. Add a New ISO**

* At the top of the page, you will see a section titled  **"Add ISO in Your Account"** .
* Below this section, there is a list of all the ISOs that have been added to your account till now.

### **3. Fill Out the ISO Details**

The following fields are required to add an ISO:

* **Datacenter** :
  * This is a dropdown menu where you select the data center (DC) in which your ISO will be stored.
  * It determines where the ISO file will physically reside. A closer data center location can result in better performance and quicker access when deploying virtual machines or servers using the ISO.
* **URL** :
  * This field requires you to provide the **URL** of the ISO file you want to upload.
  * It points to the location where the ISO file is hosted. The system uses this URL to fetch the ISO file from the source location. This could be a cloud storage service, an external server, or any web-accessible storage system. The URL ensures that the file is retrieved correctly and stored in your Utho Cloud account.
* **Name** :
  * This is a text field where you specify a name for the ISO file.
  * It helps to indentify ISO file in the system. By providing a unique and meaningful name, you can easily search, manage, and organize multiple ISOs. For example, if youâ€™re uploading an ISO for an operating system installation, you could name it something like "Ubuntu-20.04" for easy identification later.

### **4. Add the ISO**

* After filling out the necessary information, click the **Add ISO** button located next to the inputs.
* The system will begin processing your request.
* A success toast notification will appear once the ISO is successfully added, indicating that the download is in progress.

### **5. Verify the ISO Has Been Added**

* To check if your ISO has been successfully added, scroll down to the list of **Added ISOs** below.
* The list will show the following details for each ISO:
  * **Name** : The name you assigned to the ISO.
  * **Size** : The size of the uploaded ISO file.
  * **Location** : The data center location where the ISO is stored.
  * **Status** : The current status of the ISO (either the percentage downloaded or marked as Available).
  * **Action** : A delete icon next to each ISO allows you to delete the ISO if needed.
