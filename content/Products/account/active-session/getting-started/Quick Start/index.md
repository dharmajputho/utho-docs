## **Accessing Active Sessions**

1. Open the **Utho Cloud Platform** dashboard.
2. Click on **"[Active Sessions](https://console.utho.com/active-session)"** in the sidebar.
3. You will be redirected to the **Active Sessions** listing page.

Upon navigating to the **Active Session** page, users will be presented with a comprehensive list of all currently active sessions. This page provides detailed information regarding each session, including the following key attributes:

1. **Device** : The specific device from which the user has initiated the session. This could be any device such as a desktop, laptop, tablet, or mobile device.
2. **IP Address** : The IP address associated with the session, helping to identify the network location from which the user is connected.
3. **Status** : The current state of the session.
4. **Time** : The duration for which the session has been active, displaying the time since the session was initiated.
5. **Action** : The **Action** column contains a **"Log Out"** button, which allows the user or administrator to terminate a session for a specific device. Clicking on this button will immediately log the user out from that particular device, effectively ending the session and preventing further access.

### **Log Out Functionality**

The **"Log Out"** button, located in the **Action** column, provides an essential function for managing active sessions. By clicking the **"Log Out"** button next to a session, users or administrators can:

* **End the session** : Terminate the session for the corresponding device, logging the user out immediately.
* **Secure the account** : Ensure that no further access is granted from the device, providing an additional layer of security, especially if the device is shared, unrecognized, or potentially compromised.

This functionality is vital for maintaining security and ensuring that only authorized users have access to their cloud resources at all times.
