## **Quick Start Guide for Managing SSH Keys in Utho Cloud**

SSH keys are an essential part of securely accessing cloud resources, providing a safe and password-less method of authentication. In Utho Cloud, SSH keys are used to access virtual machines and other services securely. Follow this guide to generate, view, create, and delete SSH keys.

### **1. How to Generate SSH Key Content**

To create an SSH key, use the following commands based on your operating system:

#### **For Windows (using PowerShell)**

1. Open **PowerShell** and run:

   `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com`
2. Press **Enter** to accept the default location or specify a new path.
3. Optionally, set a passphrase for added security.

#### **For Mac/Linux**

1. Open **Terminal** and run:

   `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`
2. Press **Enter** to accept the default location or specify a new path.
3. Optionally, set a passphrase for added security.

After generation, the SSH key will be stored in the default directory (`~/.ssh/`). To view the public key, run:

`cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
