### **2. NAT Gateway Listing Page Overview**

On the  **NAT Gateway Listing Page** , you'll see a list of all the NAT Gateways deployed within your account. Each NAT Gateway entry contains the following details:

1. **Name** :

2. **Internet Gateway ID** :

* The **Internet Gateway ID** is the identifier associated with the Internet Gateway that the NAT Gateway uses for internet connectivity. This ID helps you link the NAT Gateway with the Internet Gateway in your network setup.

3. **Subnet ID** :

* The **Subnet ID** represents the ID of the subnet that the NAT Gateway is associated with. This helps you identify which subnet the NAT Gateway is providing internet connectivity to, usually a private subnet.

4. **Type** :

* The **Type** field indicates the type of NAT Gateway. For example, it could be "static" or other types depending on how the gateway is configured.

5. **Created At** :

* The **Created At** field displays the **creation date** of the NAT Gateway. This provides insight into when the gateway was deployed, which can be useful for tracking and auditing purposes.
