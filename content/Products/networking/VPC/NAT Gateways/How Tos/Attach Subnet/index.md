## **How to Attach a Subnet to NAT Gateway**

### **Overview**

Attaching a subnet to a NAT Gateway enables resources in that subnet to use the NAT Gateway for accessing the internet. This guide will walk you through the process of attaching a subnet to a NAT Gateway and verifying the successful attachment.

### **1. Navigate to the NAT Gateway Manage Page**

* On the left sidebar of the platform, locate the **VPC** menu.
* Under the **VPC** section, select  **NAT Gateways** .
* This will take you to the  **[NAT Gateway Listing Page](https://console.utho.com/vpc/natgateways "NAT Gateways Listing Page")** , where you can view all the existing NAT Gateways.
* Choose the **NAT Gateway** to which you wish to attach a subnet.
* Click on the **"Manage"** button next to the selected NAT Gateway. This will redirect you to the  **NAT Gateway Manage Page** .
