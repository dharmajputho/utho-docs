### **1. How to View NAT Gateways**

* From the **VPC** menu in the sidebar, select **NAT Gateways** to view the  **[NAT Gateway Listing Page]()** .
* The list shows all previously deployed NAT Gateways with key details such as:
  * **Name** : The name of the NAT Gateway.
  * **Internet Gateway ID** : The ID of the associated internet gateway.
  * **Subnet ID** : The subnet ID to which the NAT Gateway is connected.
  * **Type** : The type of NAT Gateway (e.g., Static).
  * **Created At** : The creation date of the NAT Gateway.

### **2. How to Create a NAT Gateway**

* From the  **NAT Gateway Listing Page** , click the **"Create NAT Gateway"** button at the top.
* A drawer will appear with the following configuration inputs:
  * **Name** : Enter a name for the NAT Gateway.
  * **Subnet** : Select an available subnet from the dropdown.
  * **Elastic IP Allocation ID** : Choose an existing Elastic IP or click the **"Allocate IP"** button to auto-generate a new IP.
* After filling out the necessary details, click the **"Create NAT Gateway"** button to deploy the gateway.
* A success toast notification will confirm the creation. Verify the NAT Gateway by checking the updated listing.

### **3. How to Manage a NAT Gateway**

* From the  **NAT Gateway Listing Page** , select the NAT Gateway you want to manage.
* Click the **"Manage"** button to navigate to the  **NAT Gateway Manage Page** .
* In the manage page, you will see key details of the NAT Gateway:
  * **Name** : The NAT Gateway’s name.
  * **IPv4 Address** : The assigned IP address.
  * **Status** : Whether the NAT Gateway is active or not.
  * **Tabs for Further Configuration** :
  * **Subnets** : View or modify the subnets attached to the NAT Gateway.
  * **Destroy** : Permanently delete the NAT Gateway.

### **4. How to Attach a Subnet to a NAT Gateway**

* Go to the  **NAT Gateway Manage Page** .
* Click on the **"Subnets"** tab.
* Click the **"Attach Subnet"** button.
* A drawer will appear showing a dropdown of available subnets.
* Select the subnet you wish to attach and click **"Attach Subnet"** to link the subnet to the NAT Gateway.
* Verify the attachment by checking the updated list of attached subnets.

### **5. How to Detach a Subnet from a NAT Gateway**

* Go to the  **NAT Gateway Manage Page** .
* Navigate to the **"Subnets"** tab where the list of attached subnets will be visible.
* Click the **"Detach"** button next to the subnet you want to remove.
* A confirmation popup will appear. Click **"OK"** to detach the subnet.
