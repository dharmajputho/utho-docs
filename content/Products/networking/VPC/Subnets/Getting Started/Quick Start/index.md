## **Quick Start Guide for Subnets in Utho Cloud**

### **Overview**

Subnets in Utho Cloud allow you to create isolated network environments within your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). This guide provides a concise overview of how to view, create, manage, and destroy subnets, as well as how to attach and detach NAT Gateways.

### **1. How to View Subnets**

* From the **VPC** menu in the sidebar, select **Subnets** to view the  **[Subnet Listing Page](https://console.utho.com/vpc/subnets "Subnets Listing Page")** .
* The list will show all the subnets created, with the following details:
  * **Name** : The name of the subnet.
  * **Subnet ID** : Unique identifier for the subnet.
  * **IPV4** : The subnet’s IP address.
  * **Default** : Indicates whether the subnet is the default one for the VPC.
  * **VPC ID** : The ID of the VPC to which the subnet belongs.
  * **Manage Button** : Access to manage the subnet's settings and configurations.

### **2. How to Create a Subnet**

* Go to the **Subnet Listing Page** and click the **"Create Subnet"** button.
* Fill in the details for your subnet:
  * **Subnet Name** : Provide a name for the subnet.
  * **Choose VPC** : Select the VPC where you want to create the subnet.
  * **Auto Assign Public IPv4 Address** : Choose whether to enable or disable public IP assignment.
  * **Default Subnet** : Set this as Yes or No based on your preference.
  * **Subnet Type** : Choose between Public or Private subnet.
  * **Network** : Enter the subnet's IP network (e.g., 192.168.1.0).
  * **IP Range** : Specify the subnet's CIDR block size (e.g., 24).
* After filling out the form, click  **"Create Subnet"** .
* You will receive a success notification once the subnet is created, and you can verify it by checking the updated subnet list.

### **3. How to View Subnet Configuration**

* Go to the **Subnet Listing Page** and click on the **Manage** button for the subnet you want to view.
* By default, the **Configuration** tab will show the subnet’s configuration details, including:
  * **Name**
  * **DC Location**
  * **Status** (Running if active)
  * **VPC ID**
  * **IP Range**
  * **Subnet Type** (Public/Private)
  * **Auto Assign Public IPV4** (Enabled/Disabled)
  * **Default** (Yes/No)

### **4. How to Attach NAT Gateway to a Subnet**

* Go to the **Manage Page** of the desired subnet.
* In the **"NAT Gateway"** tab, click the **"Add Nat Gateway"** button.
* A drawer will appear with a dropdown list of available NAT Gateways. Select the NAT Gateway you want to attach.
* Click **"Add Nat Gateway"** to attach the selected NAT Gateway to the subnet.
* You can verify the attachment by checking the updated list of attached NAT Gateways in the **"NAT Gateway"** tab.

### **5. How to Detach NAT Gateway from a Subnet**

* In the **Manage Page** of the subnet, go to the **"NAT Gateway"** tab.
* For each attached NAT Gateway, there will be a **"Detach"** button.
* Click the **"Detach"** button next to the NAT Gateway you want to remove.
* The NAT Gateway will be immediately detached, and no confirmation will be required.

### **6. How to View Attached Resources**

* Go to the **Manage Page** of the subnet.
* Click on the **"Resources"** tab to view a list of all resources (like cloud servers or storage) attached to the subnet.

---

### **7. How to Destroy a Subnet**

* In the  **Subnet Listing Page** , click the **"Manage"** button next to the subnet you wish to destroy.
* Navigate to the **"Destroy Subnet"** tab.
* Click the **"Destroy Subnet"** button.
* A confirmation popup will appear. Enter the exact name of the subnet to confirm.
* After confirming, click **"Destroy"** to permanently delete the subnet.
* You will be redirected to the Subnet Listing Page where you can verify that the subnet has been destroyed.
