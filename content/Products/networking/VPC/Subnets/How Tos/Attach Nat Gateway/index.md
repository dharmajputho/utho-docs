## **How to Attach a NAT Gateway to a Subnet in Utho Cloud**

### **Overview**

Attaching a NAT Gateway to a subnet in Utho Cloud allows resources within the subnet to access the internet via the NAT Gateway, ensuring efficient management of outbound traffic. By following a few simple steps, users can easily attach a NAT Gateway to a subnet and verify the attachment.

### **1. Navigate to the Subnet Listing Page**

* On the left sidebar of the platform, look for the **VPC** menu item.
