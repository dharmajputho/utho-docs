## **How to Destroy Subnet in Utho Cloud**

### **Overview**

Destroying a subnet in Utho Cloud allows users to permanently remove a subnet from their VPC configuration. This is useful when no longer needing a subnet or when performing cleanup operations. In this guide, we'll walk through the steps required to destroy a subnet, ensuring that you can easily remove unwanted subnets from your network infrastructure.


### **1. Navigate to the Subnet Listing Page**

* On the left sidebar of the platform, look for the **VPC** menu item.
* Under the **VPC** section, select **Subnets** (subsection).
* Clicking on **Subnets** will redirect you to the **Subnet Listing Page** where you can view all the subnets you have created.

You can also access the Subnet listing directly by clicking this [link to Subnet Listing](https://console.utho.com/vpc/subnets "Subnets Listing Page").
