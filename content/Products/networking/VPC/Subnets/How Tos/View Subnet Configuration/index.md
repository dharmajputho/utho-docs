## **How to View Subnet Configuration in Utho Cloud**

### **Overview**

Viewing the configuration of your subnets in Utho Cloud allows users to check and manage the details of their network configurations. This includes subnet name, IP range, type, VPC association, and more. By accessing the subnet's manage page, users can verify or modify the configuration settings of a specific subnet.

### **1. Navigate to the Subnet Listing Page**

* On the left sidebar of the platform, look for the **VPC** menu item.
* Under the **VPC** section, select **Subnets** (subsection).
* Clicking on **Subnets** will redirect you to the  **Subnets Listing Page** , where you can view all the subnets created within your account.

You can also access the Subnets listing directly by clicking this [link to Subnet Listing](https://console.utho.com/vpc/subnets "Subnet Listing Page").
