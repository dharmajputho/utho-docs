## **How to View Attached Resources in Utho Cloud**

### **Overview**

Viewing the attached resources to a subnet in Utho Cloud allows users to manage and track the cloud resources (such as cloud servers) that are connected to a specific subnet. By accessing the subnet's manage page and navigating to the "Resources" tab, users can easily view all the resources currently associated with that subnet.

### **1. Navigate to the Subnet Listing Page**

* On the left sidebar of the platform, look for the **VPC** menu item.
* Under the **VPC** section, select **Subnets** (subsection).
* Clicking on **Subnets** will redirect you to the  **Subnets Listing Page** , where you can view all the subnets created within your account.

You can also access the Subnets listing directly by clicking this [link to Subnet Listing](https://console.utho.com/vpc/subnets "Subnets Listing Page").
