## **How to Deploy a VPC in Utho Cloud**

### **Overview**

Deploying a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a crucial step in creating an isolated network for your cloud resources in Utho Cloud. The VPC setup allows you to define your cloud networkâ€™s IP address range, name, and data center location. Once created, you can manage your network resources securely.

### **1. Navigate to the VPC Listing Page**

* After logging into the Utho Cloud platform, find the **VPC** section in the sidebar.
* Under  **VPC** , click on **VPCs** (subsection) to access the  **VPC Listing Page** .
* You can also access the VPC listing directly by clicking [here](https://console.utho.com/vpc "VPC Listing Page").

---

### **2. Click on "Create New VPC"**

* On the  **VPC Listing Page** , locate the **"Create New VPC"** button at the top of the page.
* Click the **"Create New VPC"** button to be redirected to the VPC Deployment Page.

### **3. Fill in VPC Deployment Details**

On the  **VPC Deployment Page** , you will need to provide the following inputs to create a new VPC:

#### **a. DC Location**

* This is where you will choose the **data center location** where you want your VPC to be deployed. Utho Cloud provides multiple data center locations, and selecting one depends on your regional preferences or requirements.

#### **b. VPC Name**

* Enter a **name** for your VPC. This name will help you easily identify and manage the VPC in the future, especially if you have multiple VPCs.

#### **c. Network**

* Enter an **IP address range** for the network. This will define the IP block that your VPC will use. For example, you might enter something like `10.137.0.0/20`. This ensures that your VPC is assigned a specific subnet of IP addresses.

#### **d. Network Size**

* Enter the **network size** as a numeric value. This represents the size of the subnet mask. For example, a value like **24** would define a smaller network range with fewer available IPs, while larger values like **16** would allow more IPs to be assigned within the range.

### **6. Verify VPC Deployment**

* To verify if the VPC has been deployed successfully, return to the  **VPC Listing Page** .
* The newly created VPC should appear in the list, with all the details you provided during deployment, including  **Location** ,  **Name** ,  **Network** , and  **Network Size** .
