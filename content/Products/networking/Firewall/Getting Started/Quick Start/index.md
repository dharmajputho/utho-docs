## **Quick Start Guide for Managing Firewalls in Utho Cloud**

A **Firewall** in Utho Cloud helps secure your cloud infrastructure by controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic. It acts as a barrier between your cloud servers and external networks, allowing you to define rules to permit or block specific types of traffic. Managing firewalls effectively ensures that only authorized traffic can access your servers while preventing unauthorized access, protecting sensitive data and resources.

### **1. How to Deploy a Firewall**

* Navigate to the **Firewall Listing [Page](https://console.utho.com/firewall)** and click the **"Create New Firewall"** button to start the deployment process.
* Fill in the required details:
  * **Name** : Provide a unique name for your firewall.
* Click the **"Deploy Firewall"** button to initiate the deployment. Once deployed, you will be redirected to the firewall manage page.

### **2. How to Add Rules to a Firewall**

* Navigate to the **Manage Page** of the firewall.
* By default, you will be on the **Rules** tab.
