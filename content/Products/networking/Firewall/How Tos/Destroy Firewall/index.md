# **How to Destroy Firewall**

This guide will show you how to destroy a firewall and dissociate it from any cloud servers associated with it. Once destroyed, the firewall will be permanently deleted, and any servers connected to it will no longer be protected by that firewall.

### **1. Navigate to the Firewall Listing Page**

* After logging in, go to the  **Firewall Listing Page**.
* Here all the firewalls deployed in your account are listed.
* You can directly access this page by clicking [here](https://console.utho.com/firewall "Firewall Listing Page").

### **2. Select the Firewall to Manage**

* Find the firewall that you want to destroy.
* Click the **"Manage"** button next to the selected firewall to go to its manage page.

### **5. Click the "Destroy Firewall" Button**

* A red colored **"Destroy Firewall"** button will be visible.
* Click on this button to initiate the destruction process.
