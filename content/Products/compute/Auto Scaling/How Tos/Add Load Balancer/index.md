## **Impact of Attaching a Load Balancer**

* **Traffic Distribution** : Attaching a load balancer allows traffic to be evenly distributed across multiple Auto Scaling instances, improving performance and availability.
* **Increased Availability** : With the load balancer, your Auto Scaling instances can handle more traffic while ensuring high availability during peak demand.
