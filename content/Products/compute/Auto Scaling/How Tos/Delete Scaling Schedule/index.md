2. **Select the Desired Auto Scaling Instance**

5. **Confirm Deletion**

### **Impact of Deleting Scaling Schedule**

* Once a scaling schedule is deleted, it will no longer trigger scaling actions for the selected auto scaling instance based on the defined time and recurrence.
* Deleting a scaling schedule cannot be undone, so ensure the schedule is no longer needed before deletion.
