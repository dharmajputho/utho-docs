# **How to Attach a Target Group to Auto Scaling**

## **Overview**

Attaching a **Target Group** to an auto scaling instance helps distribute incoming traffic efficiently across your instances. This feature is essential for load balancing and improving application performance.

## **Steps to Attach a Target Group to Auto Scaling**

1. **Go to the Auto Scaling Listing Page**
   * Navigate to the auto scaling listing page in your account, or click [here ](https://console.utho.com/auto-scaling "Auto Scaling Listing Page")to directly access it.
2. **Select Your Auto Scaling Instance**
   * Choose the auto scaling instance you want to manage.
   * Click on the **Manage** button to navigate to the instance's management page.

## **Impact of Attaching a Target Group**

* **Traffic Distribution:** Attaching a target group ensures that incoming traffic is distributed evenly among the instances in your auto scaling group, optimizing load balancing.
* **Improved Performance:** With a target group, the system can handle more traffic by directing it to healthy instances, which enhances the performance and availability of your application.
