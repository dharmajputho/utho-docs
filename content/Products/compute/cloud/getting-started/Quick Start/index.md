9. **Public IP:** A **Public IP** in a cloud server is an IP address that allows external access to the server from the internet. Enabling a **public IP** makes the server reachable from anywhere, which is essential for hosting websites, APIs, or services. **Disabling** it removes internet access, making the server accessible only within the private cloud network, enhancing security. You can enable a public IP during server creation or assign it later, while disabling it typically involves releasing the IP or adjusting firewall settings. Public IPs are often dynamic by default but can be made static for consistency.
10. * **VPC Network** : A **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** is a private, isolated network within a cloud environment, allowing you to securely launch and manage resources like virtual machines and databases. It gives you full control over network configurations, IP ranges, and security settings. **Subnets** are divisions within a VPC that help organize resources; **public subnets** provide internet access, while **private subnets** are isolated for sensitive resources. VPCs enhance security, enable flexible network design, and allow you to configure traffic flow using firewalls and route tables. They also help improve scalability and high availability by distributing resources across multiple availability zones.Select a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network available at your chosen location to isolate and secure your cloud environment. Also you can create vpc is there is no vpc on the selected dc loaction.
    * **Firewall** : A **firewall** is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. In cloud servers, firewalls help protect against unauthorized access by filtering traffic, ensuring only trusted sources can communicate with your server. They can be configured to allow or block specific IP addresses, ports, or protocols. Cloud providers offer **virtual firewalls** (like AWS Security Groups or Azure Network Security Groups) to protect instances and resources. Firewalls enhance security by controlling access to both public and private cloud resources, preventing potential attacks such as unauthorized access or DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks.Enable or disable firewall protection to control incoming and outgoing traffic.Also you can create firewall if there is no firewall.
    * **CPU Mpdel:**

      **Intel** and **AMD** are the two major CPU manufacturers.

Utho's network configuration allows users to manage various network settings for their cloud instances, including public and private IP addresses and VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) assignments. This section provides detailed information on how to manage these network settings effectively.

#### IPv4 Public IP Address

In this section, users can view all public networks associated with their cloud instance. The information is displayed in a table format, including the following details for each public network:

* **IP Address** : The public IP address assigned to the cloud instance.
* **Gateway** : The gateway for the public network, which routes traffic between the cloud instance and other networks. A **Gateway** is a network device or router that acts as the entry or exit point between two networks (e.g., between a local network and the internet). In cloud networking, the **default gateway** connects your instances to external networks, like the internet. It is essential for directing traffic between private cloud resources and the public internet or other external systems.
* **Netmask** : The subnet mask for the public network, defining the network's IP range. A **Netmask** (or subnet mask) defines the range of IP addresses that belong to a specific subnet in a network. It determines which part of an IP address refers to the network and which part refers to the host. In cloud environments, the netmask is used to partition network resources and control IP address allocation within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
* **RDNS** is the process of resolving an IP address back to its associated domain name. Unlike DNS, which maps domain names to IP addresses, DNS maps IP addresses to domain names. In the cloud, rDNS is used for identifying the source of traffic and improving security (e.g., anti-spam measures). It helps verify that the server sending requests is authorized, enhancing trust and reducing the likelihood of malicious activity.For each public network, users have the following options:

Utho provides transparent billing details and options to manage your cloud server's billing cycle and costs effectively.

### Billing Cycle

A **billing cycle** is the period of time between two consecutive billings for a service or subscription. In the context of cloud services, it refers to the recurring time frame (e.g., monthly, quarterly, or annually) for which usage is measured and billed.

The billing section displays current billing cycle details:

* **Current Billing Cycle**
* **Discount**

### Costs Breakdown

The breakdown of costs associated with your cloud server includes:

* **Total Cost:**   Total Cost refers to the overall expense incurred for using a service or product over a specific period. In the context of cloud services, it includes all charges for resources like compute, storage, bandwidth, and additional services. It’s the sum of all individual costs associated with running your infrastructure in the cloud.
* **OS Cost:** OS Cost refers to the charges associated with the operating system (OS) running on a virtual machine (VM) in the cloud. Some cloud providers charge extra for licensing specific operating systems (like Windows or certain enterprise Linux distributions). For example, Windows Server typically comes with additional licensing costs compared to Linux distributions, which are often free
* **Cloud Cost:** Cloud Cost refers to the overall expenditure related to using cloud services, including compute power, storage, networking, and other resources provided by cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). Cloud cost can include:
* **Compute charges** (based on virtual machines or instances)
* **Storage costs** (for databases, file storage, backups)
* **Data transfer fees** (for inbound and outbound traffic)
* **Additional services** (such as load balancers, security, and monitoring tools)
* **Backup Cost:** Backup costs refer to the expenses of storing and managing data backups in the cloud. These costs depend on factors like storage type (e.g., standard vs. archival),  data volume ,  backup frequency , and  retention period . Cloud providers charge for the amount of storage used and may offer different pricing for faster or slower access. Additional costs can come from managed backup services and features like encryption or monitoring. Optimizing backup strategies can help reduce unnecessary costs.

### Additional Charges

* **18% GST** : GST will be applied extra to the total cost.
