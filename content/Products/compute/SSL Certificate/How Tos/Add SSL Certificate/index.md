* Clicking this button will open a drawer with the following input options for creating a new SSL certificate:

#### 1. **Name**

* This is the **name** of the SSL certificate. It helps you identify the certificate within your account.

#### 2. **Certificate**

* This is the **SSL certificate content** itself. It's the actual certificate provided by your certificate authority (CA), typically in the format shown:

  ```
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  MIIBIjANBgkqh...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  ```

#### 3. **Private Key**

* This is the **private key** associated with the SSL certificate. It should be kept secure, as it is used to decrypt information sent to your server.

  ```
  -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  MIIEowIBAAKCAQEA...
  -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  ```

#### 5. **Certificate Chain (Optional)**
