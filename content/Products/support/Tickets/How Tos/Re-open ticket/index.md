# **How to Re-open a Ticket**

## **Overview**

The **Re-open Ticket** feature allows you to re-open a closed ticket by adding a reply. When you add a reply to a closed ticket, the status automatically changes to "Open," and the ticket will be re-opened for further communication with the relevant department.
